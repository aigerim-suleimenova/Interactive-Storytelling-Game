# Interactive-Storytelling-Game
Developed a platform that enables users without technical skills to create branching, choice-based interactive stories.

Overview
A platform for creating branching interactive stories without any programming. Inspired by Choice of Games and Project Aon, this tool helps users design choice-based narratives with conditional logic and non-linear progression. Can also be adapted for chatbot-like experiences or educational content.

Features
No-code visual editor for creating stories

Support for conditional branching

Dynamic rendering of pages based on choices

Export/share stories

Mobile: [Dart]
Backend: [Java]


Usage

Motivation
Building interactive content is hard for non-programmers. This project simplifies that by offering a visual tool to structure branching stories and logic-based flows with zero coding.
